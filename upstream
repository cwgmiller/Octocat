The "upstream" remote is usually used for pushing work from a local repository to a remote repository; usually when working on a cloned work and pushing suggestions on someone elses' code. For example, if I was working locally on a Makers Academy project and wanted to share it on github, I would use the upstream remote to push the suggested work which would need to be accepted by Makers Academy before being added to their repository.
